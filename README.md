# Machine-Learning

Welcome to the Machine-Learning repository.

I created it to add some best practices in machine learning and deep learning. In addition, it contains cool functions to automate machine learning workflow. 

The Exam-Creator folder contains an ongoing personal and educational project to help my son at school. It combines docTR OCR and Open AI API to create true/false, fill-the-blanks and multiple-choice questions based on an image from a textbook.

I hope you like it.
